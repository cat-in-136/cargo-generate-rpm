# cargo-generate-rpm

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) helper command to generate a binary [RPM package](https://rpm.org/) (.rpm) from Cargo project.

This command does not depend on `rpmbuild` and generates an RPM package file without a spec file by using [rpm-rs](https://crates.io/crates/rpm-rs).

## Install

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate-rpm
```

## Usage

```sh
cargo build --release
strip -s target/release/XXX
cargo generate-rpm
```

Upon run `cargo generate-rpm` on your cargo project, a binary RPM package file will be created in `target/generate-rpm/XXX.rpm`.
You can change the RPM package file location using `-o` option.

In advance, run `cargo run --release` and strip the debug symbols (`strip -s target/release/XXX`), because these are not run upon `cargo generate-rpm` as of now.

## Configuration

This command obtains RPM metadata from [the `Cargo.toml` file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html):

### `[package.metadata.generate-rpm]` options

* name: the package name. If not present, `package.name` is used.
* version: the package version. If not present, `package.version` is used.
* license: the package license. If not present, `package.license` is used.
* summary: the package summary/description. If not present, `package.description` is used.
* assets: (**mandatory**) the array of the files to be included in the package
  * source: the location of that asset in the Rust project. (e.g. `target/release/XXX`) Wildcard character `*` is allowed.
  * dest: the install-destination. (e.g. `/usr/bin/XXX`) If source contains wildcard character `*`, it must be a directory, not a file path.
  * mode: the permissions as octal string. (e.g. `755` to indicate `-rwxr-xr-x`)
  * config: set true if it is a configuration file.
  * doc: set true if it is a document file.
* release: optional string of release. Ignored if `--release` is specified via CLI.
* epoch: optional number of epoch.
* pre_install_script: optional string of pre_install_script.
* pre_uninstall_script: optional string of pre_uninstall_script.
* post_install_script: optional string of post_install_script.
* post_uninstall_script: optional string of post_uninstall_script.
* requires: optional list of Requires
* auto-req: optional string `"no"` to disable the automatic dependency process
* obsoletes: optional list of Obsoletes
* conflicts: optional list of Conflicts
* provides: optional list of Provides

### `[package.metadata.generate-rpm.{requires,obsoletes,conflicts,provides}]` options

Dependencies such as "requires", "obsoletes", "conflicts", and "provides" shall be written in similar way as dependencies in Cargo.toml.

```toml
[package.metadata.generate-rpm.requires]
alternative = "*"
filesystem = ">= 3"
```

This example states that the package requires with any versions of `alternative` and all versions of `filesystem` 3.0 or higher.

Following table lists the version comparisons:

|Comparison|Meaning|
|----------|-------|
|`package = "*"`|A package at any version number|
|`package = "< version"`|A package with a version number less than version|
|`package = "<= version"`| A package with a version number less than or equal to version|
|`package = "= version"`| A package with a version number equal to version|
|`package = "> version"`|A package with a version number greater than version|
|`package = ">= version"`| A package with a version number greater than or equal to version|

It is necessary to place a space between version and symbols such as `<`, `<=`, etc...
`package = "version"` is not accepted, instead use `package = "= version"`.

This command automatically determines what shared libraries a package requires.
There may be times when the automatic dependency processing is not desired.
In this case, the package author may set `package.metadata.generate-rpm.auto-req` to `"no"` or
the user who executes this command may specify command line option `--auto-req no`.

 * `--auto-req auto`: The following rules are used to determine the preferred automatic dependency process:
   * If `package.metadata.generate-rpm.auto-req` set to `"no"` or `"disabled"`, the process is disabled.
   * If `/usr/lib/rpm/find-requires` exists, it is used (same behaviour as `--auto-req /usr/lib/rpm/find-requires`).
   * Otherwise, builtin procedure is used (same behaviour as `--auto-req buitin`).
 * `--auto-req builtin`: the builtin procedure using `ldd` is used.
 * `--auto-req /path/to/find-requires`: the specified external program is used. This behavior is the same as the original `rpmbuild`. 
 * `--auto-req no`: the process is disabled.

## Advanced Usage

### Workspace

To generate an RPM package from a member of a workspace, execute `cargo generate-rpm` in the workspace directory
with specifying the package (directory path) with option `-p`:

```sh
cargo build --release
strip -s target/release/XXX
cargo generate-rpm -p XXX
```

`[package.metadata.generate-rpm]` options should be written in `XXX/Cargo.toml`.

When the option `-p` specified, first, the asset file `source` shall be treated as a relative path from the current directory.
If not found, it shall be treated as a relative path from the directory of the package.
If both not found, `cargo generate-rpm` shall fail with an error.

For example, `source = target/bin/XXX` would usually be treated as a relative path from the current directory. 
Because all packages in the workspace share a common output directory that is located `target` in workspace directory.

### Cross compilation

This command supports `--target-dir` and `--target` option like `cargo build`.
Depending on these options, this command changes the RPM package file location and replaces `target/release/` of
the source locations of the assets.

```sh
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo generate-rpm --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

When `--target-dir TARGET-DIR` and `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` are specified, a binary RPM file will be created
at `TARGET-DIR/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/generate-rpm/XXX.rpm` instead of `target/generate-rpm/XXX.rpm`.
In this case, the source of the asset `{ source = "target/release/XXX", dest = "/usr/bin/XXX" }` will be treated as
`TARGET-DIR/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/XXX` instead of `target/release/XXX`.

You can use `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable instead of `--target` option and `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET_DIR` or
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` instead of `--target-dir`.

### Payload compress type

The default payload compress type of the generated RPM file is zstd.
You can specify the payload compress type with `--payload-compress TYPE`: none, gzip, or zstd.

For the legacy system (e.g. centos7), specify legacy compress type explicitly e.g. `--payload-compress none`.
